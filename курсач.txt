Welcome to the Cats Wiki!

Like all felids, domestic cats are characterized by supple low-slung bodies,
finely molded heads, long tails that aid in balance,
and specialized teeth and claws that adapt them admirably to a life of active hunting.


“cat pattern,” established very early in the evolution of modern mammals, was a successful one: early cats were already typical in form at a time when the ancestors of most other modern mammalian types were scarcely recognizable. They first appeared in the early Pliocene Epoch (5.3 to 3.6 million years ago), and they have continued with remarkably little change into modern times.
